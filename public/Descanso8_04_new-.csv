"4.1 Overview of Missions to Mars"
"Of all the planets of the inner Solar System, Mars is the most intriguing."
"While Venus is geologically our twin sister, its high surface temperatures, the"
"result of a greenhouse effect run amuck, make it quite alien and a poor"
"candidate for human exploration and search for evidence of present or past life."
"Mars, on the other hand, offers different opportunities. While today Mars is"
"very cold and dry on its surface, and its atmosphere is a thin veil of mostly"
"carbon dioxide (CO2), there is a great deal of evidence that the planet may have"
"had vast quantities of surface water. Since the days when Percival Lowell and"
"Giovianni Schiaparelli peered at the red planet, reporting what they referred to"
"as “Canali” or canals (this was an optical illusion, but it raised the scientific"
"interest in Mars), data have been mounting of what appears to be extensive"
"water erosion. Of course, where there is water, there is increased chance of"
"present or past life. In addition, further evidence indicates that just beneath the"
"surface of Mars may be permafrost containing frozen water. This water could"
"become a resource for future manned exploration."
"From the earliest years of space flight, Mars has been a favorite destination;"
"however, it has not proven to be the easiest locale to reach. Table 4-1 provides a"
"historical overview of unmanned missions to Mars [1–4]. As can be seen, only"
"about one-third of the attempts have been successful, however, those that"
"succeeded have provided a wealth of knowledge about our intriguing red"
"neighbor."

"during the last half of the flight would fall within the main lobe of the antenna."
"The antenna’s primary function was to transmit telemetry to Earth during the"
"last half of the transfer orbit and for 20 days after planetary encounter during"
"the video playback period. The S-band LGA was mounted on a 253.3-cm tall"
"mast next to the HGA. Its function was to receive commands from Earth during"
"the entire flight and to transmit flight telemetry to Earth during the first half of"
"the mission when the spacecraft was near Earth and the look angles to Earth"
"varied widely. The telecommunications system used a dual S-band 7-W triode"
"cavity amp/10-Watt (W) traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) transmitter and"
"a single receiver, which could send and receive data via the LGA and HGA [7]."
"Both the HGA and the LGA are further described in Chapter 3 in the"
"Mariner 5 section."

"4.2.2   Mariners 6 and 7"
"The Mariner 6 and 7 missions [8] used a twin set of spacecraft and"
"employed a design very similar to the Mariner 3 and 4 spacecrafts (see"
"Fig. 4-2). Both missions were considered a success. The antenna compliment"
"was similar to the Mariner 3 and 4 system in that it contained both an LGA and"
"an HGA. However, both designs were modified for improved performance [9]."
"The earlier Mariner LGA was a simple design, but it had some fabrication"
"problems. Its conical feed and waveguide diameter had to be held to very tight"
"tolerances, or polarization losses would be high due to the use of a circular"
"polarization in the waveguide. Its return loss was high due to the manner in"
"which the cruciform aperture was formed by crimping one end of the"
"waveguide tube. The antenna also had high back radiation due to currents on"
"the outer surface of the circular waveguide."
"Using linear polarization from waveguide input to the aperture and"
"converting to circular polarization at the aperture relieved tolerance"
"requirements on the feed since linear polarization is less sensitive to"
"dimensional changes than circular polarization. The aperture design was also"
"modified to give the highest gain at the 40-deg cone angle while still above the"
"minimum requirement at the 90-deg cone angle."
"The LGA is shown in Fig. 4-3. It consisted of a circular waveguide mast"
"with a series of mode-suppression pins. Toward the end of the waveguide, near"
"the radiating aperture a four-pin polarizer was employed to provide circular"
"polarization. The antenna achieved a gain of ~7.5 dB and a 3-dB beamwidth of"
"88 deg. This LGA design (or slight variations) was reused on Mariners 8 and 9,"
"as well as the Viking orbiter spacecraft."
"The Mariner 4 HGA gain was too low to support the higher data rate"
"requirement, and its gain contours did not fit the trajectory geometry. For the"
"higher gain, a 40-in. (101-cm) diameter circular diameter with a suitable left-"
"hand circularly polarized (LHCP) turnstile feed was used (see Fig. 4-4). The"

"The Viking spacecraft represented the first U.S. attempt to land on Mars"
"[11,12]. It could also be considered the first truly successful mission of its kind,"
"although the Soviet Mars 3 did successfully land and did return a fuzzy video of"
"the surface before succumbing to a violent sand storm."
"The twin Viking spacecraft (Viking 1 and Viking 2) each consisted of an"
"orbiter and a landing module, as shown in Figs. 4-5 and 4-6. Upon arrival into"
"Mars orbit, the lander module was deployed to the surface, leaving the orbiter"
"behind as a signal relay from the Martian surface back to Earth as shown in"
"Fig. 4-7 [13]."
"The orbiter antenna compliment consisted of a fixed S-band HGA, the now"
"familiar S-band LGA on a mast, and an ultra-high frequency (UHF) quadrafiler"
"helix mounted on a ground plane."
"The lander antennas [14,15] included a gimbaled S-band HGA direct-to-"
"Earth link, an S-band turnstile LGA direct-to-Earth link, and a UHF turnstile"
"antenna for link with the orbiter. The use of a direct-to-Earth link in"
"conjunction with an orbiter relay link became the standard model for all future"
"surface-operation missions."

"The Viking spacecraft begin a trend toward highly populated/integrated"
"spacecraft. Evidence of this is seen as its traditionally isolated LGA field of"
"view is impinged upon by various spacecraft assemblies. In addition, the highly"
"populated lander incorporated two LGAs in close proximity to the top deck"
"instruments. This trend makes antenna pattern predictions very difficult"
"(particularly at UHF). To retire some of the uncertainty, mathematical models"
"are sometimes employed, but as a safer approach, mock-ups of the vehicles are"
"constructed, and antenna patterns are measured."
"Of some interest is the use of UHF as the surface-to-orbiter link frequency."
"It was highly desirable to cover as much of the planet at a single time as"
"possible in order to maximize the available link time with the lander. During"
"the early years of balloon-borne and other high-altitude experiments on Earth"
"by the French and others, it was determined that UHF provides a broad and"
"very pervasive coverage, bending around objects and generally facilitating a"
"reasonable link. The UHF band thus became the choice for surface links with"
"the first Mars landers, and that tradition continues through the present."
"Another point of interest that is of particular importance for landers on the"
"Martian surface is the potential for ionization and multipactor breakdown"
"within and around the antennas and their associated microwave components."
"On the surface of Mars, the atmospheric pressure is approximately 4–12 T"
"(533 Pa–1600 Pa) versus 760 T (101,325 Pa) at sea level on Earth. These low"

"discontinuity was interactions with and between the pair of ceramic radomes"
"used in the lander and backshell LGAs. It was necessary to adjust the thickness"
"of these radomes to prevent filtering effects at the operating frequencies."
"The HGA was used for the majority of the data transfer between the lander"

"and Technologies Corporation. It consisted of an array of printed dipoles"
"mounted over a ground plane (separated by a Nomex honeycomb layer) (see"

"achieve the required circular polarization. The polarizers were layered atop the"

"avoided by using rounded tips on the radiating elements as was done for the"
"Viking antenna (see Fig. 4-13). As is well known, pointed tip (very small radius"
"of curvature) radiating elements have high electric fields in the vicinity of the"
"point, these fields give can facilitate the corona/ionization problem. In the case"
"of a Mars-based antenna, the problem is even more difficult. When the gas"
"pressure is very low, in addition to stripping electrons off of neighboring gas"
"atoms, electrons are emitted from the radiating element metal itself. These"

"higher frequencies with short wavelengths) cannot gather enough momentum."

"case of the Viking UHF antenna, this was done by surrounding the element"
"with a foam cap. For the MER program, it was found that wrapping the antenna"
"in black (carbon-loaded) Kapton tape raised the work function enough to"
"prevent corona at our operational power of 15 W."
"Figure 4-36 shows the rover UHF antenna operated in a vacuum chamber"
"with a back-fill of simulated Mars gas (mostly CO2). The pressure of the gas"
"was varied while a fixed excitation power fed the antenna. As this was done,"
"the antenna began to generate corona/ionization. At first the effect was quite"
"local, around the tip of the monopole. As the pressure was lowered, the mean"
"free path increased, increasing the area over which the corona occurred. Finally,"
"when the pressure was so low that there was no longer any gas to ionize, the"
"effect stopped. It should be noted that this type of ionization is rather benign in"
"terms of its ability to damage the RF hardware. In the case where there is"
"extremely high potentials, an ionization event can break down the intervening"
"gas generating a instantaneous arc of electric current which has sufficient heat"
"energy to damage the equipment. This type of ionization is not a problem for"
"the MER rover UHF antenna."
"As was mentioned in Section 4.3.2.2, the original descent UHF antenna"
"design was susceptible to the corona effect. This antenna employed an exposed"
"metal ball at the tip of the radiating element. It was found that by encasing the"
"radiating element in Vespel, the work function was raised sufficiently high to"
